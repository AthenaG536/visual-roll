#Visual Roll
##Share pictures between friends and family.

*Visual Roll* is a cluster.co clone that aims to provide a space for users to share images privately among friends and family. 

Share photos of groups, events and occasions between other members by invite only. This invite only function will help keep your photos private and only shared with those you actually want to be able to see, unlike most photo sharing sites that allow sharing with all accepted friends/followers with occasional restriction settings (that can are quite difficult to use regularly).
 
Get notifications for every like and new photo added to one of your groups/albums.

Using *server side rendering* will allow this site to be loaded faster, improving user experiences.
